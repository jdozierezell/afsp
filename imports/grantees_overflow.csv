Dr. Adler examines how suicidal ideation shifts to suicidal behavior for some people. The study tests a key feature of the cognitive model of suicidal behavior, specifically that suicide attempts occur when suicidal ideation interacts with an attentional fixation on suicide, thus intensifying suicidal ideation until it reaches a threshold of intolerable emotional pain. Attentional fixation is a cognitive disturbance characterized by difficulty reasoning and difficulty disengaging attention away from suicide-relevant cues and can ultimately lead to a preoccupation with suicide as a solution to one’s problems. A total of 114 people will participate in the study: 57 being seen in the emergency department after attempting suicide; and 57 being seen in the emergency department for psychiatric reasons including suicidal ideation without a suicide attempt. Participants will complete an interview and a self-report measure of their suicidal thoughts, impulsivity, problem-solving behaviors, depression, anxiety and alcohol use. The contributions and differences among these variables will be compared between groups. Understanding how suicidal ideation shifts to suicidal behavior is critical for suicide prevention efforts.<br /><br /><strong>Impact: </strong>Interventions aimed at reducing attentional fixation, improving problem solving and shifting focus away from suicide.",,,,

DNA or gene structures vary from person to person as genes copy themselves. Over time, imperfections in this process, known as ""disruptions,"" can lead to large losses or increases in DNA. CNVs have been shown to be important, although uncommon, sources of risk for some psychiatric disorders. Dr. Ernst will examine the relationship between CNVs and suicide risk among individuals with bipolar and unipolar depression by comparing individuals with a history of suicide attempts and individuals without a history of a suicide attempt. His hypothesis is that those with a history of a suicide attempt will carry CNVs with 1) more disrupted genes; 2) larger disruptions; and 3) more possible problems in the way the genes are interpreted in the brain. In addition, he will examine whether CNV disruptions found in people who have made suicide attempts are also found in people who died by suicide.

The proposed study aims to model the neurobiological mechanisms at the intersection of anxiety and depression, and is only possible because in some cases, patients with intractable epilepsy require the surgical implantation of electrodes in the amygdala in order for surgeons to identify the brain region responsible for producing seizures. These electrodes will be used to record local neuronal activity and to deliver small electrical currents to the amygdala to study its function in relation to suicidal thoughts, general mood, and anxiety.  Each participant will be assessed at baseline with measures of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thinking. The participants will then be asked to complete two tasks; one task will be to rate their current mood and the next task will be to rate the happiness or sadness of facial expressions shown on a computer. Both of these tasks will be administered under two conditions, once with stimulation of the amygdala and once without. During both of these tasks Dr. Bijanki-Rowe’s team will record activity of the amygdala neurons, rates of the participants’ respiration, heartbeat, and skin conductance, all considered  markers of anxiety and negative mood.

She is currently a NIMH "Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Fellow at Harvard University.<br /><br /><strong>Research Categories:</strong> Neurobiological - brain functioning, Psychosocial<br /><br /><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rate of suicidal behavior begins to increase during adolescence and this may be related to developmental changes in neurobiology and brain function at that time. Key neurobiological changes take place during adolescence: the subcortical brain region matures early, which relates to a person’s reward-focused behavior, while prefrontal systems in the brain are also still developing, which relates to behavioral control. In short, adolescents have too much ‘acceleration’ in without fully functioning ‘brakes’ in behavior.  This neurobiological model can explain to risk-taking behavior in these adolescents with depression. To increase our understanding of the relationship between brain development and suicidal behavior, Dr. Glenn will assess 40 adolescent females with major depression who are aged 13-17 years old, half of whom will have mad suicide attempt within the last year and half who report no history of suicidal ideation or suicide attempts. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to measure brain function during tasks related to risk-taking and behavioral inhibition and control.  In addition, self-report measures will be administered to assess suicidal ideation and behavior as well as impulsiveness.

Avoidance in addressing the loss complicates necessary grief-related processing. In contrast, yearning for the bereaved allows for exposure to memories of the deceased and leads to acceptance of the loss. Furthermore, several theories of bereavement have suggested that rigidity in any type of grief style also confers risk for subsequent mental health problems. Dr. Schneck will use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task and measure yearning, avoidance, rigidity and acceptance in 30 people with suicide related grief as compared to 15 people with non-suicide related grief. He hypothesizes that the groups will differ in terms of yearning, avoidance, rigidity and acceptance and that neural markers will be related to changes that occur during the grief process. Participants will be assessed shortly after their loss and again six months later. In addition to assessing yearning, avoidance, rigidity and acceptance, an emotional Stroop Test and continuous memory induction task about their loved one will be administered to elicit these behaviors during each fMRI scan.<br /><br /><strong>Impact: </strong>Increased understanding of suicide related grief leading to interventions to facilitate the grief process.",,,,

Dr. Donaldson builds upon previous research to explain how stressful experiences interact with genetics to impact brain activity and risk for suicidal behavior. This study examines the effects of both genetic and environmental impact on the functioning of a serotonin gene which has been extensively linked with suicide. The study will use both post-mortem human brain tissue, as well as a humanized mouse model, to examine the relationship among stress, genetic variation/expression, and suicide. Dr. Donaldson will investigate the direct effects of variation in serotonin that are important predictors of suicidal behavior which is modeled in mice by measuring aggression, impulsivity, and decreased social engagement. The role of adversity will also be examined as a risk factor for behaviors considered as markers for suicidal behavior, to see if a history of significant stress interacts with genetic variation in relation to these proxy behaviors.<br /><br />The study’s dual approach, i.e. post-mortem brain tissue and animal behavior, leverages the validity of working with human tissue while also taking advantage of the strengths of a unique animal model to determine causal relationships. This work facilitates the future development of targeted interventions and therapeutics by providing a mouse model for testing pharmacogenetic treatment pathways and may provide guidance for predicting individualized treatment outcome.<br /><br /><strong>Impact: </strong>Personalized treatment to reduce suicide risk.",,,,
