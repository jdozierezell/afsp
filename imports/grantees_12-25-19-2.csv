<strong>Abstract: </strong>Studying the family members of individuals who died by suicide helps us understand more about genetic vulnerability for risk factors for suicide   by comparing them with individuals with a family history of depression and no suicide and those with no family history of either depression or suicide.  Dr. Jollant will use the brain imaging technique known as fMRI to discover whether cognitive and emotional vulnerability traits are shared within families. During brain imaging, participants will be asked to respond to faces expressing various emotions including anger, sadness, and happiness, and they will also perform the Iowa Gambling Task that measures an individual’s thinking flexibility and impulse control. Dr. Jollant expects that family members of those who died by suicide will perform differently on these two tasks and evidence differences in brain function.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>The Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide suggests that a person who feels more disconnected and burdensome, has less fear of death, and has an increased pain tolerance is at higher risk for suicide. These factors may contribute to current suicidal ideation above and beyond the contributions of depression, hopelessness, past suicidal ideation, history of suicide attempt, psychopathy, criminal thinking and criminal behavior. Dr. Mandracchia will administer questionnaires to inmates in the Mississippi Department of Corrections and analyze the relative contributions of these factors to suicidal ideation to test this theory.  He hypothesizes that inmates reporting less connectedness and more burdensomeness will report more suicidal ideation. An additional hypothesis is that people who report less concern for others (psychopathy) will be less likely to feel like a burden.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Hungary has among the highest suicide rates in the world, with persistently high local rates of suicide in the Southern lowlands. Hungary is also a global hotspot for highly allergenic short ragweed, and has the highest air pollution concentrations in Europe. Dr. Cook’s study addresses the link among Hungary’s relatively high burden of aeroallergens, air pollution, allergic disease, and suicide. Aeroallergens serve as a catalyst for inflammation, which has been shown to be related to mental health conditions and suicide.  His study will look at the suicide rates across Hungary in relation to peak periods of aeroallergen exposures, using air pollution as a comparator regarding association with suicide. All suicides during 2005-2011 in nine counties of Hungary spanning diverse geographic regions are included. These data will be analyzed along with daily air quality monitoring of air pollution and allergens in all of the regions. The aim will be to account for geographic and temporal variability of suicide rates across Hungary in relation to both air pollution and peak periods of aeroallergen exposure.

<strong>Research Categories:</strong> Neurobiological studies; animal studies; brain functioning studies
<strong>Abstract: </strong>Although persons with anxiety and depression are shown to be at higher risk of suicide, individuals may also have a genetic predisposition or tendency towards suicidal ideation, which is aggravated further by stressors such as poverty, social isolation, and childhood abuse. This demonstrates the need to uncover both medications that will ameliorate mood (reducing the probability of suicidal behavior), as well as more efficient antidepressants with faster onset of action. The rapid and long-lasting action of the acetylating agent L-acetylcarnitine, a well-tolerated drug, acts by enhancing the levels of the histone H3H27ac bound to the Grm2 gene. Its use strongly suggests a novel approach to examine the epigenetic mechanisms that control the proper expression of multiple genes that are involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. The researchers will conduct a stress/postmortem study with mice to examine whether an acetyl-L-carnitine treatment, which directly resets the chromatin assembly, may correct the pathological epigenetic programming associated with stress-related depression and anxiety, improving or restoring normal brain activity. This will inform us whether a novel epigenetic approach to the treatment of stress related disorders can improve or restore normal brain activity and, ultimately, ameliorate the associated deficits in cognitive processing, perception and memory function associated with suicide attempters.
<strong>Impact:</strong> Understanding how epigenetic mechanisms modulate stress-sensitive endpoints affords the opportunity to explore the molecular mechanisms of current antidepressants and to develop novel pharmacological approaches to rapidly treat and prevent psychiatric disorders, as well as providing insight into how individuals sharing similar genes might show large difference in disease susceptibility.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite ongoing prevention efforts, suicide rates have continued to increase in the United States and worldwide. Dr. Klonsky suggests that improved knowledge about motivations for suicide would greatly enhance conceptual models of suicide, and translate directly into more effective prevention and treatment. In order to examine motivations for suicidal behavior, 100 adults hospitalized on a psychiatric unit after having made a suicide attempt in the previous seven days will complete a self-report measure and participate in an interview. The goal is to demonstrate the reliability and validity of the Inventory of Motivations for Suicide Attempts (IMSA), a scale which assesses the motivations for suicide attempt. This measure includes scales for hopelessness, psychache, escape, burdensomeness, lack of belongingness, fearlessness, help-seeking, interpersonal influence, problem-solving, and impulsivity. The IMSA will be administered to every participant in order to gather information on what motivated them to attempt suicide. Additional instruments to measure of suicidal ideation and behavior, and coping strategies for managing stress will be administered. By articulating motivations for suicidal behavior we will gain information about how to best assess risk for suicide and potentially develop targeted interventions.

<strong> </strong><strong>Abstract: </strong><span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Suicidal ideation is a predictor of suicidal behavior and yet most people with suicidal ideation never make a suicide attempt. Dr. Adler examines how suicidal ideation shifts to suicidal behavior for some people. The study tests a key feature of the cognitive model of suicidal behavior, specifically that suicide attempts occur when suicidal ideation interacts with an attentional fixation on suicide, thus intensifying suicidal ideation until it reaches a threshold of intolerable emotional pain. Attentional fixation is a cognitive disturbance characterized by difficulty reasoning and difficulty disengaging attention away from suicide-relevant cues and can ultimately lead to a preoccupation with suicide as a solution to one’s problems. A total of 114 people will participate in the study: 57 being seen in the emergency department after attempting suicide; and 57 being seen in the emergency department for psychiatric reasons including suicidal ideation without a suicide attempt. Participants will complete an interview and a self-report measure of their suicidal thoughts, impulsivity, problem-solving behaviors, depression, anxiety and alcohol use. The contributions and differences among these variables will be compared between groups.

<strong>Research Category:</strong> Psychosocial
<strong>Abstract: </strong>The suicide rate of elderly persons is the highest among all age groups in China, as in most other countries. There have been no psychological autopsy studies in this population in China to help understand the risks. With dramatic urbanization in the past few decades, a lot of elderly individuals in rural China are left behind because their grown-up children move to work and live in cities. Using a case-control psychological autopsy study, Dr. Zhou will examine the relationship between socio-economic transition in rural China and suicide among elderly.  He will examine whether loneliness, lower social support, and life stress may be related to being left behind and act as mediating factors in this relationship after controlling for other risk factors.
One hundred people from three sampling rural counties in Hunan province, China who died by suicide will be compared with 100 living elderly people matched by gender, age, and resident county. Measures of being left behind, mental health, depression, loneliness, life events, social support, social economic status, physical illness and disability, previous suicide attempt, family history of suicide, access to lethal pesticides, and demographic characteristics will be administered to two informants for to the person being described. The first informant will always be a family member (i.e., a spouse or adult child); the second informant will always be a friend, a neighbor, or someone who knows him/her well. Then two face-to-face interviews will be conducted between two to six months after the suicide death with the goal of obtaining information about suicide in the elderly in China.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Adolescents who have attempted suicide and also have an alcohol use disorder are at increased risk for a repeat suicide attempt. Given the significant role alcohol may play in suicide attempts, a careful assessment of and initial treatment for alcohol use by adolescents receiving inpatient psychiatric treatment is critical for reducing risk for future suicide attempts. Studies suggest that brief motivational interviewing (MI) interventions are helpful in reducing alcohol use among adolescents. Dr. O’Brien will conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate a brief motivational interviewing intervention that includes personalized feedback addressing alcohol use as a risk factor for continued suicidal ideation and attempts, and includes a family component to facilitate parent support of the adolescent. Fifty adolescents psychiatrically hospitalized for a suicide attempt who have a co-occurring alcohol use disorder will be randomized to receive either a brief MI intervention or treatment as usual. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be assessed.   Data will be collected via questionnaires and in-person interviews at one and three month follow-up assessments to evaluate changes in suicidal thoughts and behaviors, as well as alcohol use and alcohol treatment outcomes. Dr. O’Brien expects that the treated group will have reduced frequency of alcohol use, increased likelihood of receiving alcohol treatment, and reduced suicidal ideation at follow-ups.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>It is estimated that 25% to 65% of individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) attempt suicide, and that 4% to 19% of individuals with BD eventually die by suicide. Sleep disturbance is a primary indicator and causal symptom of mood episodes, and recently has been found to be associated with higher rates of suicidal ideation and behavior. Dr. Sylvia will use a non-invasive innovative home sleep monitoring device called the Embla to characterize sleep profiles in adult outpatients with BD, and will use the findings to examine the association of sleep with suicidal ideation and behavior in this population. Fifty-five patients who have experienced suicidal ideation or a recent suicide attempt and sleep disturbance will participate in a one month treatment. Participants will wear the Embla device for Week 1, participate in a brief sleep intervention for suicide during Weeks 2 and 3, and then wear the Embla device for one more week in Week 4. The intervention consists of two 60-minute sessions using a manualized form of cognitive-behavioral therapy to reduce sleep disturbance. Patients will continue treatment as usual with minimum medication changes during the study. Dr. Sylvia hypothesizes that from pre- to post-intervention, individuals will report less sleep disturbance as well as decreased suicidal ideation and behaviors. If effective, the treatment will ultimately be available for clinical use.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Suicide is three times more frequent in elderly adults compared to younger people. Unfortunately, predicting and preventing suicidal behaviors in elderly people remains difficult. Clinical, biological, and genetic data suggests that suicidal behaviors may be best understood within a stress-vulnerability model where more vulnerable individuals are at increased risk of engaging in suicidal behaviors when experiencing stress. Vulnerability to suicidal behavior has also been associated with specific changes in brain and the ways people think and problem solve, i.e., cognition. One of the relevant cognitive functions is cognitive inhibition, a function dedicated to controlling and selecting the most advantageous thoughts and behaviors. Dr. Richard-Devantoy will use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to examine the neural basis of the vulnerability to suicidal behavior in elderly, with a particular focus on cognitive inhibition and how it is change by emotions. Based on the neurocognitive model underlying the study, the primary focus will be to assess the imbalance between emotions and regulatory processes.
Three groups will be compared:  25 elderly people who are depressed and have a personal history of suicidal behaviors; 25 elderly people who are depressed with no personal or first-degree family history of suicidal behavior; and 25 elderly people without a psychiatric history and no personal or first-degree family history of suicidal behavior or depressive disorder. Participants will be between 65 and 85 years old. Participants will complete a thorough mental health and suicide risk assessment and a go-no go reaction time task during the scan. Findings from this study will improve the understanding of the brain basis of suicidal behaviors in elderly, and will help to define potential predictive risk factors.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> The information people use to make decisions can affects the way they problem-solve and respond to stressful experiences.  This may relate to whether or not someone thinks about suicide or decides to act on suicidal thoughts.  Decision-making processes and emotion processing play a role in suicidal behavior, yet the mechanism is still not well understood.
In this study, four decision-making mechanisms will be studied in 90 psychiatric inpatients with depression (30 with a current substance abuse disorder, 30 who have a recent suicide attempt, and 30 who have both a substance abuse disorder and a recent suicide attempt).  These groups will be assessed with the Cambridge Gambling Task (to assess decision-making), the Affect Misattribution Procedure (to assess impact of hidden emotional information), and tasks assessing the body’s physical response to a stressor or a reward (startle eyeblink and postauricular reflex). Suicidal thoughts and behaviors will be assessed during hospitalization and at 3-month follow-up.  It is expected that the four mechanisms of risk will be associated with suicidal behavior at baseline and at follow-up, regardless of whether or not substance abuse is present.
To the degree that evidence of specific behavioral processes that maintain suicidal behavior can be identified, insight into the direction or emphases needed for cognitive-behavioral approaches for intervention will be gained. The cognitive and affective mechanisms studied have the potential for improved prediction of suicidal behavior over what is currently possible with self-report measures. In addition, as decision-making biases, automatic affect, startle eyeblink reflex, and postauricular reflex have all been suggested to be associated with different patterns of brain functioning, the findings from this study may provide insights into brain-behavior relations that may guide further research in understanding and ultimately preventing suicidal behavior.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Suicidal behavior has been shown to be related to differences in the neurotransmitter serotonin as well as to the way people experience and respond to stress.  Response to environmental stressors also contributes to suicidal behavior.  This study aims to tease apart the roles of biology and environment.  Animal models are often used to overcome the fact that we cannot directly adjust genes or neurotransmitter levels in the brain and examine the effects on behavior. Specific human behaviors associated with suicide such as aggression and decreased social connection, as well as response to stress, have been considered to represent suicide risk in mice.  Dr. Jacobson will compare wild type mice with mice with low serotonin levels and observe for behavioral changes related to aggression and impaired affiliative skills.  Mice will be raised under distinct social and environmental conditions.  They will be exposed to significant stress using a social defeat stress strategy and the two groups will be assessed and compared with regard to aggressive and social behaviors (aggression, affiliation, sociability) in adulthood.  The aim is to distinguish between the contributions of serotonin and stress to behaviors consistent with suicidal behavior.

<strong>Research Categories:</strong> Genetics, bipolar disorder, major depression
<strong>Abstract: </strong>Dr. Ernst is working to identify genetic risk factors for suicide by studying changes in gene structures known as copy number variations (CNV). DNA or gene structures vary from person to person as genes copy themselves. Over time, imperfections in this process, known as ""disruptions,"" can lead to large losses or increases in DNA. CNVs have been shown to be important, although uncommon, sources of risk for some psychiatric disorders. Dr. Ernst will examine the relationship between CNVs and suicide risk among individuals with bipolar and unipolar depression by comparing individuals with a history of suicide attempts and individuals without a history of a suicide attempt. His hypothesis is that those with a history of a suicide attempt will carry CNVs with 1) more disrupted genes; 2) larger disruptions; and 3) more possible problems in the way the genes are interpreted in the brain. In addition, he will examine whether CNV disruptions found in people who have made suicide attempts are also found in people who died by suicide. The mentorship goal is to develop skills to understand the genetic risk for suicide, with an emphasis on the association between CNVs and suicide.

We created the Focus Grant, our first million-dollar grant.
Each year our research department will request applications for studies that focus on a specific area of suicide prevention that has been determined by AFSP and its Scientific Council. AFSP’s inaugural Focus Grant targets short-term suicide risk, and we awarded the grant to Dr. Matthew Nock, a pioneer in the field of suicide research.
His study combines clinical evaluation measures with computer-based implicit association tasks that together could reliably predict a patient’s short-term suicide risk. The resulting assessment tool could be implemented in emergency departments, and it would signal clinicians to take steps to address suicide risk in the near term.
We asked Dr. Nock to tell us how he came to study suicide and what his plans are for the grant he has received from AFSP. His answers are below.
<p class=""lead""><strong>What motivated you to study suicide?</strong></p>
My introduction to suicide came while I was working as an undergraduate in a psychiatric hospital in London. Many of the patients in the locked ward where I worked were severely self-injurious and suicidal. The level of suffering these patients experienced was staggering. I wanted to help, and was surprised to discover that even mental health professionals did not fully understand what drives suicidal behavior, or how to prevent it. Since then I’ve been driven by an intense desire to better understand suicidal behavior so that we can find new methods to identify those at risk, and discover the best ways to help them.
<p class=""lead""><strong>How did you get the idea for the Focus Grant study?</strong></p>
Our proposed study synthesizes three arms of research that my colleagues and I have been working on. Our goal is to combine our three best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior and test whether this combined approach enhances prediction beyond what is currently possible. We also want to design a screening tool that could actually be used in a real-world clinical setting where many patients at high short-term risk for suicidal behavior are seen: the emergency department. If successful, we hope to have a clinical tool that can be used to improve the short-term prediction of suicidal behavior.
<p class=""lead""><strong>What are some of the challenges suicide researchers face?</strong></p>
Suicide researchers face many challenges: scientifically, clinically, and logistically. Scientifically: suicidal behavior appears to be the end result of a complex interaction of factors occurring at multiple levels of analysis. Teasing apart how these different factors come together to produce suicidal thoughts—and lead to suicidal behavior—is an extremely difficult process. Clinically: we have relied primarily on people’s self-reporting of their own suicidal thoughts. This method of data collection is not ideal, in large part because people who are thinking about suicide often do not tell others about such thoughts. Logistically: although suicide is a leading cause of death, suicide and suicide attempts are low base-rate behaviors, which means we need very large sample sizes to study suicidal behavior in a fine-grained way. We hope to overcome some of these challenges with our current project.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Major Depression is strongly associated with suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. When a person has been admitted to the hospital after attempting suicide, the time after they are discharged is a period of high risk for attempting suicide again. To improve upon existing research and find new feasible interventions, Dr. Huffman will use Positive Psychology to treat those with major depression who have made a suicide attempt and are recently discharged from care. A six week phone-based positive therapy treatment will be provided at discharge to 25 patients with major depression who had been admitted to the hospital for suicidal behavior; 25 additional patients also recently discharged will serve as a comparison group. Positive exercises such as acts of kindness towards others, a letter of gratitude, and writing a best-self life plan will be encouraged. Patients’ suicidal ideation, well-being, and hopelessness will be measured before and after the six weeks, and the intervention is expected to improve well-being and reduce hopelessness and suicidal ideation and behavior. Dr. Huffman hopes to find that Positive Psychology effectively guides a new and feasible treatment to reduce suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior in those who are recently released from hospital care.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>The amygdala, an almond-shaped structure in the brain, plays a key role in anxiety and depression, two key underpinnings of suicide. The proposed study aims to model the neurobiological mechanisms at the intersection of anxiety and depression, and is only possible because in some cases, patients with intractable epilepsy require the surgical implantation of electrodes in the amygdala in order for surgeons to identify the brain region responsible for producing seizures. These electrodes will be used to record local neuronal activity and to deliver small electrical currents to the amygdala to study its function in relation to suicidal thoughts, general mood, and anxiety.  Each participant will be assessed at baseline with measures of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thinking. The participants will then be asked to complete two tasks; one task will be to rate their current mood and the next task will be to rate the happiness or sadness of facial expressions shown on a computer. Both of these tasks will be administered under two conditions, once with stimulation of the amygdala and once without. During both of these tasks Dr. Bijanki-Rowe’s team will record activity of the amygdala neurons, rates of the participants’ respiration, heartbeat, and skin conductance, all considered  markers of anxiety and negative mood. The study examines the neurological basis for suicidal thoughts.

<strong> </strong><strong>Abstract:</strong> The human body hosts tens of trillions of microorganisms, referred to as microbiota. Recently, great interest has emerged in understanding the nature of this mutually‐beneficial arrangement between the gut and these organisms. A number of studies in mice have shown that gut microbiota influence the development of various neurotransmitter systems in the brain, including serotoninergic signaling. Brain serotonin has been found to relate to suicidal behavior, and this pilot study examines whether gut bacterial diversity in humans is associated with the concentration of 5‐HIAA (a measure of serotonin) in cerebrospinal fluid, with a particular focus on suicidal behavior. If measures can be taken from stool samples to understand what is going on in the brain, figuring out helpful assessment techniques and treatments may be possible.
This pilot study will build on an ongoing observational study, funded by the National Institutes of Health. Twenty participants in the larger study, 10 with and 10 without a history of suicide attempts, will undergo a spinal tap to measure the concentration of 5‐HIAA in their cerebrospinal fluid. The participants will also provide a stool specimen within three days to measure bacterial composition and diversity. The associations among gut bacterial diversity, 5‐HIAA, history of suicidal behavior, and aggression and impulsiveness will be examined. The goal is to understand some of the biological mechanisms associated with suicidal behavior.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Infection with toxoplasmosis is a lifelong condition that compromises a person’s immune system, and manifests with flu-like symptoms. This condition is prevalent worldwide, and is caused by a parasite. It has been shown to have correlations with suicide and suicide attempts. Most people who have a major depressive disorder have higher levels of inflammatory markers. Dr. Coryell, Dr. Evans, and Dr. Wilcox’s study will examine how the body’s inflammatory process (cytokines) plays a role in suicidal behavior in depressed individuals. Their study will include 300 participants age 18 and older with a current or past clinical diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The participants will be assigned to one of two groups: Those in the suicide attempt history group will have a have at least two suicide attempts, one of which has occurred in the preceding year; the non-suicide attempt group will have no previous suicidal behaviors. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Participants will be given a score 1 through 6 to represent the number of depressive symptoms active in a given week. They will also have their blood drawn and analyzed for toxoplasma, and cytokine concentrations will be determined.  The presence and relevance of antibodies to toxoplasmosis as a reflection of the body’s immune response will be studied in relation to suicidal behavior in people with depression.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Anxiety has been found to be related to suicide attempt risk. Emotion dysregulation, which refers to maladaptive ways of dealing with one’s emotions, is a common symptom of a person who has anxiety. Dr. Jager-Hyman’s study seeks to advance our understanding of the relationship between anxiety and suicide attempts, especially in patients who visit the psychiatric emergency department (ED). This study will also take a look at the association between emotion dysregulation and suicidal risk. The sample will consist of 50 participants visiting an ED following a suicide attempt in the previous 48 hours and 50 people presenting to the ED for psychiatric concerns in the absence of a suicide attempt. Participants will complete a clinical interview assessing history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, along with self-report measures assessing anxiety and depression. Also, the <em>Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, </em>a computer-based behavioral measure of emotion dysregulation, will be used. Findings from this study will help to further explain the association between anxiety and suicide attempts with an emphasis on those who are seen in emergency departments.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Suicide remains a leading cause of death for youth and yet little is known about how suicide risk changes over the course of emerging adulthood. Identifying risk factors that predict the maintenance of suicide risk as well as protective factors that predict decreasing risk in a nationally representative sample will allow for targeted interventions that can decrease fatal and nonfatal self-directed injuries.
In order to understand and better predict risk among developing youth we must better understand what maintains—or decreases—suicidal risk as youth transition into emerging adulthood. Dr. Thompson’s study will include 20,745 youth from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data and will use restricted data to assess what puts youth  more at risk for suicidal ideation as they transition into adulthood, and also what protective factors decrease suicidal ideation. It is hypothesized that some youth initially at high risk will decrease in risk status as they mature, yet some youth will maintain high-risk status. The study will set out to examine whether certain intrapersonal, social/situational, and cultural/environmental risk and protective factors can be used to predict individuals’ likely trajectory, thereby providing a basis for targeted prevention programming. Youth will be between the ages of 12-17 years at Time 1 and between the ages of 25-32 years at Time 4. State-of-the-art statistical procedures for testing the study aims will entail latent growth mixture modeling and multinomial logistic regression analysis. The study will help to identify risk factors that predict maintenance of suicide risk and protective factors that predict reduction in risk as youth transition into adulthood.

<strong>Research Categories:</strong> Neurobiological - brain functioning, Psychosocial
<strong>Abstract: </strong>The rate of suicidal behavior begins to increase during adolescence and this may be related to developmental changes in neurobiology and brain function at that time. Key neurobiological changes take place during adolescence: the subcortical brain region matures early, which relates to a person’s reward-focused behavior, while prefrontal systems in the brain are also still developing, which relates to behavioral control. In short, adolescents have too much ‘acceleration’ in without fully functioning ‘brakes’ in behavior.  This neurobiological model can explain to risk-taking behavior in these adolescents with depression. To increase our understanding of the relationship between brain development and suicidal behavior, Dr. Glenn will assess 40 adolescent females with major depression who are aged 13-17 years old, half of whom will have mad suicide attempt within the last year and half who report no history of suicidal ideation or suicide attempts. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to measure brain function during tasks related to risk-taking and behavioral inhibition and control.  In addition, self-report measures will be administered to assess suicidal ideation and behavior as well as impulsiveness. The goal is to gain understanding about adolescents who are suicidal and have difficulty weighing reactivity to reward when they need to restrain their behavior.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Completed suicide is relatively infrequent and large samples are needed for informative family genetic studies of suicide. Because of this, the first recommendation in the Institute of Medicine’s report on suicide was for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to “develop and support a national network of suicide research Population Laboratories devoted to interdisciplinary research on suicide and suicide prevention across the life cycle."" The University of Utah houses the Utah Population Database (UPDB), a unique database that contains linked, de-identified medical, census, birth/death, marriage/divorce, driver’s license, and demographic records on over seven million individuals dating from 1750 to the present. The goal of this pilot study is to lay the foundation for a sustained research program of population-level suicide research. Dr. Crowell’s study has two primary aims: (1) to construct high risk family trees or pedigrees of families with multiple suicides, and (2) to examine the relative risk for suicide and intentional, non-fatal self-injury within those family trees in comparison with families without suicidal behavior. She hypothesizes that rates of suicide and self-injury will be elevated within high-risk pedigrees relative to case-matched controls. The establishment of this database will provide a national resource that can be linked with other public databases for studying suicide and suicidal behavior.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>It is difficult to understand the thinking of someone who attempts or dies by suicide. Some people seem to act impulsively while others seem engaged in premeditated and deliberate suicidal behavior. Both types of thinking can be deadly. Dr. Szanto will investigate decision profiles associated with a predilection to deliberate (planned attempts with high medical lethality) versus impulsive (less premeditated attempts often causing less medical damage) suicide attempt. Decision-making abilities will be assessed at four complementary levels: 1) behavioral (decision-making in the laboratory); 2) cognitive (decision making problems); 3) self-report (of problem-solving, impulsivity, and interpersonal reactivity); and 4) real-life (history of poor decisions). The study will enroll and assess 90 individuals ages 40 to 60, including deliberate and impulsive suicide attempters, depressed individuals without suicide attempts, and non-psychiatric controls. Dr. Szanto hypothesizes that she will find an association between the type of attempt that was made and the pattern of performance and responses obtained on the decision-making measures.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by problems with emotional regulation and behavioral control frequently exhibited in the form of suicidal behaviors. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is an effective treatment for BPD with co-occurring suicidal behaviors. The “DBT Coach” is a mobile technology application (app) that provides immediate, interactive coaching in DBT skills via smartphone to individuals when they need it. Dr. Rizvi is conducting a clinic-based study of the use of DBT Coach when integrated into a six-month standard outpatient DBT program for 15 individuals with BPD and chronic suicidal ideation and behavior. She is evaluating the safety, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of DBT Coach. Participants will be assessed at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and three month follow-up. She hypothesizes that individuals will report a decrease in distress and suicidal urges as a result of in vivo skills coaching by the DBT Coach, and that the frequency of use will be related to changes in suicidal behaviors, non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors, suicide ideation, urges to self-injure, depression, psychological distress, and treatment satisfaction.

<strong>Abstract</strong>: Major Depressive Disorder is one of the strongest psychological correlates with suicidal ideation and behavior, but not all depressed adolescents are suicidal. Therefore, it is critical to identify neurobiological factors that underlie suicidal behavior in depressed adolescents.

Her study will use the combination of neuroimaging techniques to determine if adolescents who have made a suicide attempt have brain structure and functioning that is different from adolescents who have never made a suicide attempt. All participants will undergo resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess functional connectivity patterns of brain networks, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess structural connectivity via white matter microstructure.  The areas examined in the brain, the orbital frontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, have been found to be associated with impulsivity, emotion regulation, and suicidal ideation and behavior in adults across different psychiatric disorders.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Suicide related grief (SRG) is linked to heightened risks for future suicidal ideation and behavior and psychiatric complications. Processing grief is an important process after a loss. Avoidance in addressing the loss complicates necessary grief-related processing. In contrast, yearning for the bereaved allows for exposure to memories of the deceased and leads to acceptance of the loss. Furthermore, several theories of bereavement have suggested that rigidity in any type of grief style also confers risk for subsequent mental health problems. Dr. Schneck will use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task and measure yearning, avoidance, rigidity and acceptance in 30 people with suicide related grief as compared to 15 people with non-suicide related grief. He hypothesizes that the groups will differ in terms of yearning, avoidance, rigidity and acceptance and that neural markers will be related to changes that occur during the grief process. Participants will be assessed shortly after their loss and again six months later. In addition to assessing yearning, avoidance, rigidity and acceptance, an emotional Stroop Test and continuous memory induction task about their loved one will be administered to elicit these behaviors during each fMRI scan.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Losing a loved one sets off a process of grief.  Some wonder if losing a loved one to suicide generates a unique bereavement process and little is known about the difference between suicide related grief and nonsuicide related grief.  Using fMRI to measure brain activity, 30 people with a suicide related grief (SRG) and 15 people with a nonsuicide related grief (nSRG) will engage in a behavioral task that measures emotional attachment and evokes avoidance and yearning related neural activity.  Participants will also be asked to complete self-report measures of emotional attachment, avoidance in addressing the loss, and yearning for the deceased.  The baseline assessment will take place 8-12 weeks after the death of a loved one, and participants will complete the self-report measures, including an assessment of complicated grief, again six months later.
The investigators hypothesize that suicide related grief will be associated with greater emotional attachment and activation of avoidance and yearning related neural circuitry compared to those with nonsuicide related grief. They further hypothesize that greater activation of avoidance and yearning neural circuitry will predict higher levels of complicated grief six months after scanning. Based on prior research they expect that avoidance/acceptance will be measured by activation of the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex parts of the brain; while yearning will be measured by activation of ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. Avoidance circuitry and yearning circuitry will be used to predict complicated grief outcomes at a six‐month follow-up. They also expect that greater avoidance and yearning will predict higher levels of complicated grief.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>The hippocampus is one of the brain regions that regulate emotional responses. It is also an area of the brain that has the ability to grow new nerve cells, known as neurons, and can make new neural connections.  Stress affects neuronal circuits and connections, and earlier research shows that 1) the hippocampus is smaller in people who have died by suicide and 2) thinking and brain functions controlled by the hippocampus are different in people who have attempted suicide when compared with those who have not.  The production and survival of hippocampal cells, known as neurogenesis, is regulated by proteins called growth or trophic factors and by the neurotransmitter serotonin. In people who have attempted suicide and in the brain of suicide victims, both trophic factors and serotonin are altered.
The goal of this study is to compare the anterior hippocampus of people with depression who died by suicide with people with depression and people without psychiatric conditions who died from other causes.   Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (neural progenitor cells, immature neuroblasts and mature granule neurons) will be studied using immunohistochemistry and stereology. The process of neuronal growth will be measured by identifying and counting cells expressing specific markers that identify their maturational phase toward becoming new neurons. The number of cells with markers regulating cell survival, gene transcription, and cell death (apoptosis) in the hippocampus will also be studied.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) is an illness characterized by episodic mood disturbance and psychosocial impairment, and suicidal ideation and behavior at rates that exceed any other childhood disorders. Dr. Weinstein is developing a targeted suicide prevention intervention for this population. She will add 30 youth age 7 to 13 and a focus on suicidal ideation and behavior to an ongoing, NIH-funded, randomized clinical trial examining psychosocial treatment for PBD. The manualized psychotherapy for PBD is a one month Child- and Family-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CFF-CBT). She hypothesizes that (1) higher rates of suicidal events will be associated with family dysfunction, child cognitive risk, and affective vulnerability (rapid mood shifts); (2) youth receiving CFF-CBT will experience a moderate, but not complete, reduction in suicidal events that will be greater than that of the control group; and (3) treatment-related changes will relate to changes in the number of suicidal events. Youth and parents will be assessed pre- and post-treatment and at six month following treatment. Data will be used to identify family, child, and affective risk factors associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. Findings will be used to develop a targeted suicidal-event reduction (SURE) intervention module designed to optimize suicide prevention in PBD.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> This study tackles suicide by examining the interaction of four domains: 1). infection (<em>T. gondii</em>); 2) aggression and impulsivity; 3) the immune response to infection (cytokines); and 4) neurotransmitters (kynurenine pathways). Two different groups of people with and without suicidal behavior are studied to test a comprehensive model of suicidal behavior.
There are many paths to suicidal behavior, and, for some people, it is through the body’s response to infection. <em>Toxoplasma</em><em> gondii (T.gondii</em>) is a common parasite kept in check inside the cells of the brain by the immune system.  <em>T.gondii</em> has been found to relate to aggression/impulsivity and to suicide attempts in some people. The mechanism of this association is not understood. Immune molecules called cytokines play a role in communication functions in the body’s defense against <em>T.gondii</em>. Two other molecules that also control the relationship between the microorganism and suicidal behavior are kynurenine (KYN) and quinolinic acid. The theory is that these molecules play a role in the relationship between <em>T.</em><em> gondii </em>and aggressive personality traits which thereby affects suicidal behavior. This study will obtain data from two sites: a site in Sweden provides the opportunity to have cytokines and quinolinic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid from people who recently made a suicide attempter and a comparison group (98 in each group), and the other site in Germany provides 950 patients with schizophrenia (351 past attempters, 599 nonattempters) and a comparison group of 1000 healthy individuals. Examining these data should provide a solid stepping stone for future interventional studies.

<strong>Abstract:</strong>Our response to stress is managed, in part, by the genetics of our hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, or stress response system. Environmental factors such as early childhood physical and sexual abuse can alter one’s HPA axis, potentially increasing the risk for suicide.  Using two state-of-the-art approaches to genetics, this series of studies will examine the genetics of the HPA axis and stress in relation to suicide.
Previously, the investigators found that suicidal behavior was linked to specific genes associated with the HPA axis.  However, a fuller picture of suicide will only emerge as genetic susceptibility is considered in combination with other factors, such as environmental risk factors and epigenetic changes (the way genes communicate). The investigators will put their efforts towards understanding how HPA axis genes and early trauma influence the risk for suicidal behavior in participants with major depression disorder (MDD). They will study 22 genes involved in the HPA axis. Genetic information will be provided by two federally funded studies, the Genetics of Recurrent Early-onset Depression (GenRED) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. This Gene-by-environment (GxE) approach may shed light on this complicated process.
In addition, the researchers will study gene expression in the prefrontal cortex of samples from post-mortem brains of depressed subjects who died by suicide, depressed people who died of other causes, and psychiatrically healthy controls. The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that organizes and controls behavior and functioning in this area of the brain has been found to relate to suicidal behavior.  Again, the 22 HPA axis genes will be the focus and the most significant genes will be validated and screened for differential expression. The availability of the data from the federally funded studies allows the investigators to take the most promising findings from one sample and validate their findings in a second sample.

<strong>Abstract: </strong><span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">Suicide is a complex behavior often triggered by exposure to stressful events, and further influenced by biological predispositions. Dr. Donaldson builds upon previous research to explain how stressful experiences interact with genetics to impact brain activity and risk for suicidal behavior. This study examines the effects of both genetic and environmental impact on the functioning of a serotonin gene which has been extensively linked with suicide. The study will use both post-mortem human brain tissue, as well as a humanized mouse model, to examine the relationship among stress, genetic variation/expression, and suicide. Dr. Donaldson will investigate the direct effects of variation in serotonin that are important predictors of suicidal behavior which is modeled in mice by measuring aggression, impulsivity, and decreased social engagement. The role of adversity will also be examined as a risk factor for behaviors considered as markers for suicidal behavior, to see if a history of significant stress interacts with genetic variation in relation to these proxy behaviors.</span>
The study’s dual approach, i.e. post-mortem brain tissue and animal behavior, leverages the validity of working with human tissue while also taking advantage of the strengths of a unique animal model to determine causal relationships. This work facilitates the future development of targeted interventions and therapeutics by providing a mouse model for testing pharmacogenetic treatment pathways and may provide guidance for predicting individualized treatment outcome.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Strong suicidal ideation is a medical emergency, and hospitals urgently need to identify fast-acting interventions that will help reduce imminent suicide risk. Ketamine may be one example of such a rapid intervention. Dr. Murrough will test the use of low doses of ketamine administered by IV for patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital for clinically significant suicidal ideation and elevated risk for suicide and examine its feasibility and tolerability. He will measure patients’ psychiatric and suicide symptoms at the time of admission and then again at 4 and 24 hours after treatment with ketamine. Dr. Murrough’s hypothesis is that ketamine will prove effective at rapidly reducing suicidal ideation. Further follow-ups to assess for safety and efficacy will be administered daily during hospitalization and weekly during the month following hospitalization, ending with one final assessment 6 months after the ketamine treatment.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Emergency department (ED) staff often possess attitudes toward suicide that limit their ability or willingness to ask about suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. This Young Investigator Grant tests two hypotheses. The first is that many providers are skeptical that suicide can be prevented. The second is that few staff members ask about access to lethal means, such as firearms, even when they know someone is thinking about suicide or has made a recent suicide attempt. The project also measures whether attitudes change after ED professionals participate in a training program designed to teach them to screen for suicide risk. Finally, ED nurses will be trained to conduct a brief intervention for patients with suicidal behavior that includes asking about access to lethal methods such as firearms. After the training, attitudes and beliefs will be assessed a third time.
<strong>Impact:</strong> To encourage better assessment and care of patients in the ED, as well as to facilitate the development of standard suicide assessment training methods for ED professionals.",Research Connection,"<strong>The Question</strong>
How do emergency department staff interact with patients at-risk for suicide?
<strong>Background</strong>
ED staff can play a critical role in suicide prevention. More than half of suicides are by firearms, and limiting access to lethal means has been proven around the world to decrease suicides. Marian Betz, M.D., M.P.H., from the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of Colorado in Denver, wanted to identify the attitudes and behaviors of ED doctors and nurses about access to lethal means. She was particularly interested in whether ED staff asked patients about access to firearms. The University of Colorado is one of eight centers collaborating in ED-SAFE, an NIMH-funded study to learn how EDs across the nation can improve their suicide assessments and interventions.
<strong>The Study</strong>
Betz surveyed 631 ED physicians and nurses.
<ul>
 	<li>Less than half of the staff considered suicide as preventable.</li>
 	<li>49% of doctors and 72% of nurses reported that they “hardly ever” personally counsel patients or families to temporarily remove or lock up guns at home.</li>
 	<li>44% of doctors and 67% of nurses believed that most or all people who die by suicide by gun would find another way to kill themselves if the gun was not available to them.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Takeaway</strong>
These findings demonstrate the importance of training ED personnel to ask patients at risk for suicide if they have access to lethal means, and to work with the patient to keep them safe should another crisis arise. These researchers are currently testing a program that teaches ED staff about suicide and how to screen for suicide risk and to conduct brief interventions including training about access to lethal means.",Related Publications,"Betz, M.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Latina adolescents have been found to experience more suicidal ideation and behavior than their non-Latina peers. In Latina families there is a strong value placed on family and allegiance to family. Commonly experienced acculturation and identity issues can lead Latinas to struggle with lack of autonomy. By studying a program designed specifically for Latina teens, Dr. Humensky seeks further understanding of specific factors that contribute to increased suicidal ideation and attempts. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the Life is Precious (LIP) program, an intervention program specifically designed to reduce suicidal risks among Latinas.  Adolescents enrolled in the program and their families will participate in the study.  The aims are to determine what contributes to enrollment and participation in the program and to develop a manual for LIP so that it can be disseminated and used by others.
<strong>Impact:</strong> This study could help to broaden the use of an evidence-based program specifically targeting reduction of suicidal ideation and behavior among Latina adolescents.",Research Connection,"<strong><span class=""header"">Background</span></strong>
Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts occur at higher rates in adolescent Latinas than among girls from other ethnic groups. For example, in New York City, information gathered by the Center for Disease Control (CDC, 2015) reported the rate of suicide attempts among Latina in grades 9-12 was 13 percent, compared to the 10 percent for non-Hispanic black girls, and 8 percent for whites (CDC, 2015). Nationwide, more than one in four Latinas in grades 9-12 report they have seriously considered attempting suicide in the prior 12 months. (CDC 2016).
Aside from self-development and the need for increased autonomy during maturation, risk factors urban teen girls may face include poverty, high crime rates, low quality housing and schools, lack of connection with parents and peers, substance use and teen pregnancy. An additional culturally specific risk factor Latina adolescents may face is a term known as <em>familism-</em> the psychological conflict and tension occurring between the expected obligation to family, respect for parents, unity, and ties to cultural traditions versus individual obligations and autonomy. This tension adds a myriad of challenges, especially if the adolescent adapts more quickly to the U.S. than their parent(s). This can lead to ambitions that differ from those of their parent(s) and feelings of disconnectedness and powerlessness in relation to family.
Little is known about culturally relevant interventions for Latinas. Unique contributors to suicide that need to be addressed for Latinas include the stress of living between two cultures, tension within the family, low academic support, and challenges in their neighborhood or home.
<a href=""http://comunilife.org/life-is-precious/"">Life is Precious (LIP)</a> is a community-based after-school program specifically designed for Latina teens to facilitate positive development. LIP is modeled to promote family relationships, academic support, creative expression, and wellness. Supporting youth in these areas is needed to decrease suicidal ideation and prevent suicidal behavior. Services and opportunities provided include school support organized through homework space and computer labs; creative expression through dance, music, and art therapy with licensed therapists; and health initiatives in the form of healthy meal preparation, exercise, and planning. Counselors and social workers are present, providing support to the participants, which may involve family therapy facilitation and education services to help students stay in school.
<strong><span class=""header"">Question</span></strong>
Can a community-based social program reduce suicidal ideation and behavior in Latina adolescents?
<strong><span class=""header"">Study</span></strong>
Over a one year period, 107 Latina adolescents aged 11-18 participated in the Life Is Precious (LIP) after-school program on weekdays and Saturday mornings in one of three locations within New York City (Brooklyn, Bronx, and Queens). Participants in this program come from a variety of referral sources such as outpatient mental health clinics, schools, hospitals, or self-referrals from the teens and their families.
At program intake, demographic data and assessments of suicidal ideation, depression, mood symptoms, and family functioning were administered. Assessments captured anger, post-traumatic stress, dissociation, and sexual concerns as well. Every four months the participants were assessed on these factors. Some individuals completed up to six assessments.
<strong><span class=""header"">Results</span></strong>
Over the course of Dr. Humensky’s study, none of the girls enrolled attempted or died by suicide. Before participating in the Life is Precious program, 17 percent reported having attempted suicide. In the general population, based on the CDC data, it is estimated that more than 14 of the 107 participants would have attempted suicide. Thus, this community-based program showed positive results with significant reductions in suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, anger, and post-traumatic stress symptoms during participation.
The greatest reduction in suicidal ideation was for Latinas who had initially reported a history of sexual abuse, and tobacco or alcohol use. Participants stated that the sense of community the program provided was more meaningful than the actual activities offered. Building connections with other girls and program staff fostered healthy communication between adolescents and their families. The mothers reported a sense of appreciation and value from LIP, and a bridging of communication with their daughters.

<strong>Research Categories:</strong> Medical student education using virtual patients, suicide risk assessment
<strong>Abstract: </strong>It has been demonstrated that educating physicians to assess for suicidal ideation and behavior, and then to treat accordingly, has reduced suicidal behavior. Dr. Foster’s randomized clinical trial seeks to demonstrate that virtual patients (VP) can be used to teach medical students to assess and treat people with suicidal ideation and behavior more effectively than simply observing a physician interviewing a patient. VPs are computerized, web-based patients with whom medical students can interact by asking questions and eliciting answers. In this study, the experimental group examines a VP named Denise who has bipolar disorder and soon makes a suicide attempt. The medical student uses virtual technology to interview the patient, and subsequently to interview her husband after she makes a suicide attempt. Throughout the process, the student receives feedback and a transcript is available for later review. The control group watches a film of a professional interviewing a standard patient about suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and family history of suicidal behavior. Finally, students from both groups complete an online survey to provide information about their demographics and experience with mental illness. Later, the medical students interview a live patient and their skill is assessed. The two groups are compared, and the hypothesis is that those who had interactive experience with the VP will have better skills with real patients than those who watched an interview.
<strong>Impact:</strong> If found to be effective, the VP will be made available to all medical students free of charge.

Bipolar disorder elevates both suicidal ideation and an adolescent’s likelihood to attempt suicide or death by suicide. Dr. Miklowitz’s study aims to reduce suicidal ideation and behavior among adolescents with bipolar disorder by using Mentalization-Based Therapy, which has been shown to be effective at reducing suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, and self-harm in adolescents with borderline personality disorder. This study will test its feasibility and efficacy for youth with bipolar disorder.  Thirty adolescents, ages 12 to 17, recruited from UCLA’s child psychiatric division, who meet the DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder and have moderate to severe suicidal ideation or a recent suicide attempt, will be eligible to participate. These youth will be randomly assigned to either traditional Family Focused Treatment or Mentalization-Based Therapy.  Progress will be measured every three months over a period of nine months to assess the efficacy of the treatment.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Mood disorders, such as major depression, are the most common precursor of suicide attempts and suicide.  Depressed individuals often go online to find information about their disorder, as well as to find help for their symptoms.  Many choose to turn to the Internet instead of connecting to trained professionals, for reasons that may range from lack of access to standard treatment to unwillingness to engage with providers because of stigma or other sociocultural factors.  Given that many individuals who attempt or seriously contemplate suicide are neverseen by qualified mental health professionals, it is imperative to study their needs and experiences in the medium of their choice—the Internet.  Dr. Leykin will recruit 1400 English-, Spanish-, Chinese-, and Russian-speaking participants worldwide.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Bipolar Disorder (BD) is associated with increased risk for suicide, with estimates that up to 50% of individuals with BD attempt suicide in their lifetime. In addition, suicide is a leading cause of death in adolescents and young adults. Research on the development of suicidal behavior in youth with BD is needed. Dr. Blumberg examines the relationship between brain development and the development of suicidal behavior in adolescents and young adults with BD. She uses brain imaging techniques such as fMRI, sMRI and DTI, and psychosocial assessments to re-examine 100 13-22 year olds who had previously participated in brain imaging and psychosocial research at Yale University. Her study includes an examination of the impact of childhood maltreatment, substance abuse, and gender related factors. Of the 100 participants who all have been diagnosed with BD, without initial suicide attempt it is estimated that over the course of the study approximately 20 participants will attempt suicide, and 80 participants will either be completely healthy (n=20) or suffer from BD and no suicide attempt (n=60). Using measures at baseline and 3 years later, Dr. Blumberg’s study will test for neural circuitry abnormalities, long-term neural pathways, and associations among brain function, suicide attempts, substance abuse and child maltreatment.
<strong>Impact: </strong>Improved understanding of brain development among adolescents with bipolar disorder to inform early identification of suicide risk.",Research Connection,"<strong><span class=""header"">Background</span></strong>
Individuals with bipolar disorder are at increased risk for suicide. It is estimated that around 50 percent of individuals with bipolar disorder attempt suicide in their lifetime and 15-20 percent die by suicide. Despite the prevalence of these issues, few studies examine the brain function and neural circuitry (how different parts of the brain connect with each other) of individuals living with bipolar disorder and suicide attempts, especially among youth.
Previous studies conducted by Dr. Hilary Blumberg with adults indicated that the neural circuits in the brains of people with bipolar disorder and suicidal behavior are different from those with no mental health disorder, and that these differences may be present early in life. This study is one of the first of its kind to use multiple neuroimaging methods to examine the neural circuitry of adolescents and young adults with bipolar disorder who made suicide attempts.
<strong><span class=""header"">The Question</span></strong>
Among youth with bipolar disorder, are there differences in brain structure and function when the person has a history of a suicide attempt?
<strong><span class=""header"">The Study</span></strong>
Sample: three groups of individuals with ages ranging from 14 to 25; 42 people with bipolar disorder without a history of suicide attempts; 26 people with bipolar disorder with a history of at least one suicide attempt; and a psychiatrically healthy control group of 45 people participated.
Structured interviews were administered to assess for current and past mental health disorders; past and current suicidal ideation and behavior; and the lethality and intent of previous suicide attempts. Participants completed self-report measures of hopelessness and impulsivity.
Three types of brain scans were administered to all participants: 1) structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) to assess gray matter volume; 2) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess white matter density; and 3) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess brain function when presented with happy, neutral, and fearful faces.
<strong><span class=""header"">The Results</span></strong>
The study found that suicide attempters and nonattempters with bipolar disorder differed significantly from the control group in terms of suicidal ideation severity, but not in impulsivity, hopelessness, medication status, lifetime comorbid substance use or dependence, mood state, psychosis, or rapid cycling. (Rapid cycling refers to rapid shifts in mood during brief periods of time.)
From the brain scans, researchers found significant differences in gray matter volume between the attempter and non-attempter groups. The attempter group had less gray matter in regions related to emotional regulation, emotional responses, and memory. They also had decreased white matter that connects brain areas involved in these functions when compared to the non-attempter group and the healthy control group.
In addition, the attempter group showed significant decreases in the processing of happy and neutral faces, and minimal decrease in the processing of fearful faces. This indicates a decrease in emotional regulation and density of white matter connections when compared to non-attempters and healthy controls. Previously, emotional dysregulation had been linked to increased likelihood of suicide attempts due to intolerable mood states. In this study, white matter was related to lethality of past suicide attempts and current suicidal ideation, suggesting a unique association with suicide risk.
<strong><span class=""header"">The Takeaway</span></strong>
There are differences in brain structure and functioning in youth with bipolar disorder who have made suicide attempts that relate to the ability to regulate emotion. These findings suggest that someday it may be possible to use brain scans to assess for suicide risk among people with bipolar disorder, which will allow for earlier and targeted intervention.",Related Publications,"Cox Lippard, E.T., Johnston, J.A.Y., Blumberg, H.P.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> While there are many contributors to suicide<em>, </em>neurocognitive processes and the way people think and make decisions play a central role by distorting the manner in which information is processed, blocking access to adaptive behavior and undermining the individual’s capacity to deal with stressful life events.  This study will attempt to identify those neurocognitive deficits that are affected by developmental changes over time and those that are constant across the life span.  The investigators also evaluate the unique contribution of neurocognitive deficits over and above other clinical risk factors in people who have made suicide attempts.  Past research indicates that vulnerability to suicidal behavior is influenced by multiple, possibly overlapping, levels of neurocognitive dysfunction.  Deficits in basic information processing and higher order executive processes that affect behavioral control, as well as psychological content are suggested to contribute to suicidal behavior. To examine individuals across the age spectrum and control for possible confounders, the researchers will comprehensively assess neurocognitive function, suicidal behavior, psychopathology, personality traits, potential factors that can affect decision-making, physical status, and medication exposure. Participants will be 120 individuals with depression and a suicide attempt in the past year, 120 individuals depression and without a suicide attempt, and 96 non-psychiatric individuals. The study will operate at three sites, with ages ranging from 16-80. This is the first study to utilize multiple empirically-validated measures of neurocognitive functioning in a single assessment battery for the purpose of finding the most efficient set of classifiers of past suicide attempt status, and also incorporates a developmental focus to investigate the possibility that different neurocognitive deficits may play a different role at different points in the life span.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>The reduction of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a key target of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). The identification of biological indicators of treatment response for NSSI in BPD is an important unmet need that has significant ramifications for optimizing treatments to reduce NSSI among these patients. Impulsivity has been identified as an essential feature of BPD that places patients at an increased risk for NSSI and suicide completion. Neuroimaging studies of impulse control, or response inhibition, implicate the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) of the brain as a critical behavioral control center for BPD patients, who show reduced activation of this region under conditions of response inhibition; that is, not acting when identifying a stimulus. Activation of the VLPFC may thus serve as a promising biological indicator of treatment-associated changes in NSSI for patients with BPD. Dr. Ruocco will evaluate activation of the VLPFC on tests of response inhibition as a possible predictor of treatment response in this high-risk group. Thirty-one outpatients with BPD and NSSI from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Canada, will be evaluated prior to and after completing six months of DBT, Patients will complete tests of response inhibition (go/no-go and stop-signal tasks) while functional activation of the VLPFC is monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy. He will test whether VLPFC activation is associated with NSSI outcome measures. This research has the potential to identify biological markers that could predict which BPD patients may be most responsive to a psychological treatment aimed at reducing NSSI.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> There is a need to further research environmental factors as a risk factor for suicidal behavior. For example, people who are exposed to Organoposphate insecticides (Op’s) have been shown to suffer from mood swings, depression, irritability, and anger. Changes in mood or impulsiveness are correlated to suicidal risk.  Dr. London is studying whether people who are exposed to OP’s in their occupation or environment are at a higher risk to attempt suicide. He will test whether long-term exposure to OP’s is associated with an increased risk of suicide by comparing 200 participants who have attempted suicide and 200 participants who have not attempted suicide. Exposure to Op’s will be measured through a detailed questionnaire documenting history of occupational and non-occupational exposure to OP’s by a questionnaire for every participant. Along with the questionnaire, the researchers will take a sample of hair follicles in the participants to measure long-term exposure to OP as well. All of the participants will be over 18 and they will be matched by age and sex with the comparison group. Dr. London and his team will conduct statistical analysis to estimate the associations between exposure to OP’s and suicide attempts.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>The body responds to stress in many ways that affect genetic material, inflammatory response and stress-related hormones. Exposure to stress is a major contributor to the development of psychiatric disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD) and factors related to suicide risk.  DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the genetic material found in every cell that directs the development of proteins and at the end of DNA, like a cap, there is a telomere that gets worn away with aging. Recent studies suggest that stress speeds up cellular aging and this process can be assessed by measuring telomeric DNA length in the blood cells from chronically stressed humans. Recently it has been demonstrated that depression and suicide are associated with advanced aging/oxidative DNA damage that occurs in a specific type of brain cell (oligodendrocyte) that provides insulation to electrical conduction along neurons in the brain.  This study will investigate the potential for advanced cellular aging to affect these cells in an area of the brain previously associated with depression and suicide. The study will examine relative telomere lengths; oxidative DNA damage; and gene expression. Tissue samples for twelve pairs of subjects/controls from three brain banks will be analyzed. Subjects will be individuals with MDD who died by suicide and a healthy comparison group who died by accidents or natural causes. Diagnoses will be determined through post-mortem interviews at time of death. Greater understanding of the molecular pathology of oligodendrocytes may yield clues to the causes of depression and suicide.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>DBT, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, is a complex treatment shown to be helpful to adolescents with suicidal ideation and behavior. This study looks at changes in how parents and their suicidal teens relate so DBT can be streamlined for use by clinicians working with self‐injuring youth.
The relationship between parent and child is very important.  Children build their self-esteem when they feel understood, appreciated and validated by their parents and others. Most children can tolerate the ups and downs in their relationship with their parents and still maintain their feelings of worthiness.  It is thought that adolescents with suicidal ideation and behavior are not as able to maintain their feelings of worthiness when faced with the fluctuations in parental validation.   Instead, their feelings of self-hate or self-aversion awareness are increased, which may increase suicide risk.   It may be that one mechanism important in DBT is that adolescent’s self-aversive thoughts in response to parental validation become more flexible and less self-deprecating, and that changes in this relationship dynamic may lead to reduced suicide ideation and behavior.
This study capitalizes on the opportunity to collect data within the infrastructure of a larger study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.  The larger study compares DBT for adolescents with suicidal behavior with those being treated with combined individual and group supportive therapy (I/GST).  Dr. Adrian will work to determine if parental validation and adolescent self-aversion awareness are changed, and what part of DBT is helpful.

<strong>Research Categories:</strong> Sexual orientation and suicidal ideation in adolescents.
<strong>Abstract: </strong>While many factors have been identified that are associated with suicidal ideation and behavior, it is difficult to predict what factors are functioning to produce such behavior in a particular individual. The goal of Dr. Sinclair’s study is to develop a method to predict changes in the severity of suicidal ideation and depression in an individual over time. She is particularly focused on sexual-minority youth and the application of Joiner’s model of suicide. Her primary aim is to demonstrate that following individuals intensively over time will allow for the identification of factors that increase and decrease suicidal ideation and behavior. Using this novel approach, she hypothesizes that: (1) individual models will predict changes in suicidal ideation more effectively than population models; (2) factors that affect suicidal ideation will be specific to each youth and their impact will change over time; and (3) individual models will successfully identify protective factors and interventions that reduce suicidal ideation over time in each youth. In order to test this, three to five youth who report high levels of suicidal ideation will be recruited from a larger, multisite, longitudinal study of suicidal ideation in LGBT youth.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Transition from care on an inpatient medical service after a suicide attempt to continued mental health care can be difficult and a time of increased risk for suicidal behavior.  With an average stay of 4 days, the inpatient medical setting offers the opportunity to deliver a well-timed intervention to engage people in ongoing treatment. Dr. O’Connor will use a randomized control trial to examine and further develop the Brief Intervention for Medically Admitted Suicide Attempt Survivors (BI-MASAS). This intervention is designed to be implemented by a wide range of care providers and requires no additional staffing. The goal of the intervention is to help the person identify the factors underlying their suicidal ideation and move more rapidly towards making a decision to reject suicide and actively address the problems that led to their suicide attempt. Ideally, the person would be more likely to engage in ongoing mental health care, including inpatient psychiatric hospitalization and outpatient mental health services as appropriate.
One hundred participants admitted to the medical floor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center as a result of a suicide attempt will be invited to participate. After a baseline assessment of factors known to contribute to suicidal attempts, half will be randomized to receive treatment as usual plus BI-MASAS and half will receive just treatment as usual. The participants in his study will be followed and reassessed at 1, 3, and 12 months in order to record their progress.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>The rate of suicide among military veterans has been found to be higher than in the general population. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with suicide and nonfatal suicidal acts by some researchers but not others, depending on their methodology. Dr. Gradus will use data from the VA hospital system in Massachusetts from 2000 to 2007, including data available from approximately 18,000 veterans with PTSD and 90,000 without PTSD, to examine the association between suicide and nonfatal suicidal acts in veterans with PTSD. She hypothesizes that: (1) the rate of suicidal behavior (suicide attempts and suicides) among veterans diagnosed with PTSD will be higher than the rate of suicidal behavior among VA patients without PTSD, and (2) the rate of suicidal behavior among veterans with PTSD and depression will be greater than for those with either a PTSD or depression diagnosis alone. She will examine the role of demographic characteristics, psychiatric diagnosis, and treatment to help clarify the relationship between PTSD and suicidal behavior in veterans who are treated in the VA hospital in Massachusetts.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Ingesting pesticides is the leading means of suicide death worldwide, killing over 300,000 people annually. Up to 20% of pesticide self‐poisonings occur soon after the person purchased the pesticide.  In this study, the problem is studied from purchasers’ and vendors’ viewpoints to develop programs to reduce suicide from pesticides.
Dr. Eddleston will work with the ongoing Safe Storage study to identify risk factors for suicide with pesticides. While the Safe Storage study focuses on limiting access to means of suicide, the focus of this study is on people who purchase pesticides and kill themselves shortly after the purchase.  Approximately 33 people who engaged in self-harm just after purchasing a pesticide (called a case) will be matched and compared with people who had access to the pesticides in the house for an extended period of time prior to their suicidal behavior (active control) and people who bought pesticides from the same shops but did not engage in any self-harm behavior (control). There will be two active controls and two controls for each case.  The goal is to understand what factors lead to suicide with pesticides.
Another goal of the study is to develop and test a program to reduce access to pesticides.  There are four possible interventions that pesticide vendors could use: farmer ID’s, waiting times, packaging size restrictions, and sales restrictions will be discussed in interviews and focus groups with vendors. The intervention determined to be the most feasible and likely to be effective will be selected for a pilot study in which all pesticide vendors in one local administrative area (population 20-40,000) will use the intervention for six months. Vendors and customers from outlets will be invited to participate in surveys to examine its acceptability. The incidence of self-poisoning cases in the area will be compared with areas in the Safe Storage study that did not use the vendor-based intervention.

<strong>Impact:</strong> Ability to identify who is most at risk and under what conditions.",Research Connection,"<strong>BACKGROUND</strong>
Suicidal ideation and behavior are influenced by a combination of feelings we have about ourselves and our future (internal affect) and feelings we have about others and the world around us (external affect). Recent life experiences can also contribute. In order to fully understand how suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge – and also go away – individuals must be studied over time.
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a tool that can be used to assess thoughts and behaviors over time, using a smartphone. In a study conducted by Dr. Lori N. Scott at the University of Pittsburgh, EMA was used to look at the specific relationship between participants’ emotions, interpersonal experiences, and suicidal ideation and behavior over time. One way to intervene and prevent suicide is to understand the sequence of thoughts and feelings close to the moment of risk, and learn what role recent interpersonal experiences play leading up to it. This study was one of the first to look at real-time changes in emotions, experiences, and suicidal ideation and behavior.
<strong>QUESTION</strong>
How, and under what circumstances, do emotions and interpersonal experiences combine to provoke suicidal ideation and behavior?
<strong>STUDY</strong>
Dr. Scott recruited 63 young women ages 18-24 from the Pittsburgh Girls study, which was a study that had assessed at-risk girls and women in the community repeatedly over many years. These individuals were known to have impulsive aggressive behavior, which is a risk factor for suicide, so this was an important group to study. Women and men have different avenues to becoming aggressive so it is beneficial to study them separately.
The participants selected for Dr. Scott’s study had experienced suicidal or self-injurious thoughts or behaviors (SITB) in the previous month and were thus considered at-risk for near-term future SITB. Participants were assessed at baseline (meaning the beginning of the study) for depression, self-injurious thoughts and behavior, and personality disorders.
Over a 21-day period, participants responded to six text prompts per day to share the feelings and experiences they had had over the previous 15 minutes, rating the degree to which they experienced each thought or behavior on a scale from one (not at all) to five (extremely). The assessments covered internalizing negative affect (feeling sad, anxious, scared, lonely, ashamed), and externalizing negative affect (feeling angry, hostile, irritable, annoyed, mad). They were also asked about any suicidal ideation and behavior, as well as aggressive behavior, they had experienced. Once per day, they were also asked about their experiences of feeling rejected or of being criticized.
<strong>RESULTS</strong>
Over the course of the study, 89 percent of the participants reported feeling rejected at least once, and 79 percent reported feeling criticized at least once. In addition, almost 10 percent of their responses to the texts referenced rejection, and seven percent referenced criticism.
With regard to suicidal thoughts and behaviors over the three-week period:
46 percent of participants reported at least one instance of thinking about engaging in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI; self-harm without any suicide intent);
27 percent reported suicidal ideation;
14 percent reported telling someone they were going to kill themself;
and 4.7 percent reported that they engaged in self-harmful behavior, either NSSI or a suicide attempt
Internalizing negative affects like sadness and guilt were associated with suicidal ideation and behavior, but externalizing negative affects such as anger were not. Negative external feelings were found to be associated with aggressive behavior. This suggests that suicidal ideation and behavior were more associated with the negative feelings people had towards themselves (internal affect) than with their negative feelings towards others (external affect).
In addition, feeling rejected, excluded, abandoned, or left out was related to suicidal ideation and behavior, but feeling insulted or criticized was not related.
<strong>TAKEAWAY</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Negative feelings that young women have towards themselves may be a contributor to suicidal ideation and behavior.</li>
 	<li>Negative feelings young women have towards others may also be important, but the contribution to suicidal thoughts or behavior is not clear from this study.</li>
 	<li>Feelings of rejection can be powerful and contribute to suicidal ideation and behavior.</li>
 	<li>Improving social support and emotional coping strategies may be helpful for those at risk.</li>
 	<li>These findings provide insights that may be useful for individuals at risk for suicide, to their therapists, and also possibly for the development of future treatment and self-management strategies.</li>

<strong>Research Categories:</strong> Major depression, ketamine, treatment resistance.
<strong>Abstract: </strong>A novel approach to the treatment of acute suicide risk has involved the use of ketamine, an anesthetic that seems to have an immediate impact on reducing depression and suicidal ideation. The proposed study involves three phases to examine an innovative administration method that may prolong the positive effects of ketamine. Phase (1) is a two-week, prospective, open-label continuation of current medications; Phase (2) a three-week, double-blind, randomized treatment with IV ketamine or a placebo for a total of six infusions in a controlled setting under the supervision of an experienced anesthesiologist; and Phase (3) a prospective follow-up for three months, with visits every two weeks. If augmentation with intravenous ketamine is found to be safe, effective, and well-tolerated, it can become a novel therapeutic tool in the outpatient or inpatient setting to help those patients who are affected by severe treatment-resistant major depression and suicidal ideation.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>This study explores the link between bipolar disorder, anxiety, and suicide. If suicidal behavior and death by suicide are conceptualized as decisions, then it makes sense to examine key aspects of decision making in these patients. The hypothesis is that suicide in patients with bipolar disorder may be related to a bias in intertemporal discounting ‐ the tendency to take smaller rewards now rather than larger rewards later. From the suicidal person’s perspective, suicide could be conceptualized as his or her hope to “get out of pain and misery now rather than later.” Bipolar patients with anxiety have more suicidal ideation and a history of more lifetime suicide attempts than non‐anxious patients, but the reason for this increased anxiety is unclear. It is possible that the anxious, depressed, bipolar person, in particular, is unable to see the “light at the end of the tunnel” (i.e. they have greater intertemporal discounting), and therefore, they are particularly prone to experiencing suicidal ideation.
In order to explore the link between bipolar disorder, anxiety, and suicide intertemporal discounting, 20 anxious, depressed, suicidal patients with bipolar I disorder will be compared with 20 nonanxious, depressed, suicidal patients with bipolar I disorder. Participants’ intertemporal discounting (small rewards now compared to larger rewards later) is studied with a decision‐making task, and the associated brain function will be measured by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Along with the hypothesis that anxious, depressed, suicidal patients have greater intertemporal accounting compared to non‐anxious, depressed, suicidal patients, the investigators expect that anxious, depressed, suicidal patients will also have higher activations in frontal and limbic regions of the brain.
This study aims to describe the relationship between biases in intertemporal discounting, anxiety, and suicide and the associated brain function and provide insights for both psychosocial and biological interventions for preventing suicide.

In response, some health care systems use an “urgent care” or “next-day appointment” (NDA) clinics for follow-up. NDAs serve as short-term crisis intervention at a specific appointment time and location so patients do not “fall through the cracks” in the care transition.  However, studies indicate that these clinicians are inadequately trained to provide proper assessment and management of suicidal patients. Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) is a promising outpatient treatment framework that merits rigorous study as a potentially effective intervention to reduce short term suicidal risk in the transition from inpatient to outpatient treatment. Pilot data suggest that CAMS decreases suicidal ideation and psychological distress while increasing hope, patient satisfaction, and retention more than NDA treatment as usual (TAU). CAMS in the NDA clinic has the potential to fill three key targets highlighted in the 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention: (1) prevent suicidal behavior, (2) increase clinician confidence and willingness to see suicidal patients, and (3) are sufficiently feasible, trainable, adaptable, and flexible to scale up across health systems.
To this end, we propose the following study aims: (1) Evaluate whether CAMS for suicidal NDA patients results in less suicidal behavior than TAU, (2) Evaluate whether CAMS for suicidal NDA patients results in less suicidal ideation and intent as well as improved mental health markers than TAU, and (3) Evaluate whether CAMS for suicidal NDA patients is more satisfactory to patients than TAU.   We propose to recruit 200 adults referred to the study from any of the four inpatient psychiatry units, two emergency departments, and two consultation-liaison psychiatry services at two University of Washington medical centers – a publicly funded county medical center and our university medical center. Primary inclusion criteria will be: 1) recent suicide attempt and 2) without follow-up care after discharge.  Participants will be randomized to CAMS or TAU. Blinded outcome assessments will be conducted at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months to assess suicidal ideation, intent, and behavior, quality of life, functioning, psychological distress, and satisfaction with the therapy. State administrative records for hospitalizations and deaths will be collected for five years prior and 12 months follow-up to validate self-report and provide independent evaluation of results. If CAMS is found superior to TAU, training and implementation studies will be considered the next step. Such an easy-to-train intervention could meet a critical need in the care transition from hospital to outpatient care to reduce short term risk for suicidal individuals and be both a feasible and effective approach for saving lives.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Clinicians need more information about the links between non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior, and effective interventions for addressing NSSI in adolescents. Dr. Hughes will use an intervention for adolescent suicide attempters called the Safe Alternatives for Teens and Youth (SAFETY), adapting it specifically for youth presenting with NSSI. She will test the adapted SAFETY intervention by randomly assigning 30 treatment-seeking youth with significant self-harm behavior to receive Enhanced Treatment As Usual (Enhanced TAU) vs. SAFETY. Youth and families in the SAFETY group will receive weekly intervention sessions for three months. The SAFETY intervention aims to reduce the risk of suicide attempts by targeting individual and environmental risk and protective factors using a cognitive behavioral approach. Youth and families in the Enhanced TAU group will receive one intervention session targeted at enhancing safety, reducing self-harm and suicide risk, and highlighting the importance of outpatient treatment to address NSSI and any psychiatric symptoms. They will also receive monthly check-ins to encourage linkage to community care. Outcomes will be assessed at three and six months. Dr. Hughes predicts that the SAFETY intervention will be feasible, tolerable, acceptable, and safe. In addition, she predicts that the rate of repeat NSSI will be lower in the SAFETY group compared with the Enhanced TAU group at the three-month assessment.

<strong>Research Categories:</strong> Neurobiological, biomarkers
<strong>Abstract: </strong>A crucial task in suicide research is to identify biological processes that contribute to suicide risk and may be amenable to clinical intervention. Many previously identified risk factors are not modifiable, e.g. prior attempt history, sex, and age. Dr. Sublette is studying three potentially modifiable traits that have all been linked with suicide risk in depression, and with each other: plasma proinflammatory cytokines, plasma omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and aggression. Dr. Sublette has developed a theoretical model, based on pilot data and existing literature, which will allow testing, in a quantitative way, the relative associations of each of these factors to suicidal behaviors. The hypothesis is that the chronic stress of omega‐3 fatty acid deficiency leads to inflammation and aggression, which contribute to suicidal behaviors. Statistical mediation analysis will allow determination of the relative strengths of the associations between each of the three components of this model, which can indicate whether a particular component is a likely target for clinical intervention.  The combination of these biomarkers that most effectively predicts suicide attempter status will also be examined.
One hundred and sixteen adults with major depression will participate, half with a history of a suicide attempt. This project will be integrated into an existing project, and thus, under separate funding, the participants will be recruited and will be characterized through a comprehensive battery of psychiatric, psychological, medical, and biological assessments. For this study, information about dietary intake of omega‐3 fatty acids will be gathered, and blood samples will be obtained. Measures of omega-3-fatty acids, plasma glycerophospholipid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapenaenoic acid (EPA) will be determined along with plasma proinflammatory cytokines and the novel inflammatory markers, Tolllike receptors.  Testing all these factors together in one sample is an unprecedented design that should provide important, quantitative information concerning the relationships between them as they relate to a history of suicide attempts.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. Adolescents are also at a high risk for insomnia and sleep problems which lead to self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Adolescents who die by suicide are five times more likely to have insomnia during the week before death. Dr. Asarnow, Dr. Linehan, and Dr. Berk’s study will focus on clarifying the significance of ongoing sleep problems in relation to self-harm and suicide. Sleep problems are also related to difficulties regulating emotion which is a pathway to self-harm behaviors. Their study will build upon an existing NIMH-funded study, and they will examine sleep from self-report measurements. They will use a laboratory measure to assess processes that affect emotion regulation. There will be 100 youth participants aged 12-18 who are at high risk of suicide attempts due to their suicidal ideation, emotion dysregulation, and repetitive self-harm. Youth will be asked to record their sleep habits for 10 days and they will also participate in a telephone interview about their suicidal ideation and self-harm. The parents of the youth will also participate in the phone interview. These follow up measures will be assessed at 6 months and 12 months.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Suicide is the leading cause of death among prisoners. Trends show that suicide rates increase with age, and the fastest-growing prison population is age 50 and older, indicating a risk of increasing suicide rates in our prisons. Among the elderly, disability in acts of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing and dressing, is associated with suicidal ideation above and beyond other known risk factors such as a previous suicide attempt or depression. In prison, in addition to the typical ADLs, prisoners engage in prison-specific ADLs (PADLs), like being able to drop to the floor, walk to meals, hear instructions, or get up onto a bunk bed. Dr. Barry will administer interviews and questionnaires to 190 prisoners in three Connecticut prisons to examine the role of PADLs as well as other ADLs and known risk factors for suicidal ideation and behavior. These risk factors include psychiatric and medical illness, depression, social support, history of alcohol or drug use problems, prison sentence, and type of offense. If PADLs are indeed contributing to suicidal ideation, there may be easy remedies to help reduce suicidal ideation.

<strong>Research Categories:</strong> Psychosocial, community intervention
<strong>Abstract: </strong>There is evidence that media reporting of suicide, particularly sensationalized media reporting that includes details of suicide methods may increase the short-term occurrence of suicide deaths by those methods and possibly overall. At the same time, there is some preliminary evidence that media reports emphasizing coping strategies and other positive messages to people contemplating suicide may improve access to mental health services and possibly prevent suicide in the time period following their publication. Dr. Sinyor’s study will examine associations between the suicide rate in the city of Toronto from 1998 to 2013 and media reports about suicide. The study will identify all print and online reports on suicide in the Toronto media occurring during the study period as well as online social media reporting of suicide for 2013.  Rates of suicide deaths will be identified through a review of coroner’s records. The objective is to determine whether media reporting influences the occurrence of suicide and, most importantly, which specific attributes of media reports are positively or negatively associated with suicide rates.
<strong>Impact</strong>: Informed public health policy for media reporting of suicide.",Research Connection,"<strong>BACKGROUND</strong>
Preventing access to lethal means can save lives, particularly for those with impulsive suicidal thoughts. Lowered rates of suicide in areas that have erected barriers on bridges are one example.
Conversely, media reporting on suicide can give rise to a contagion effect, also known as the Werther Effect, whereby a publicized suicide can precipitate suicidal behavior in those at risk. Media coverage and published articles with certain keywords and opinions toward suicide can have an impact on suicide rates.
The Bloor Street Viaduct in Toronto, Canada is a site that had a high rate of suicide, making the construction of a barrier a critical prevention effort. Media reporting surrounding the bridge was frequent, and increased in the four years after the building of the Bloor Street Viaduct in 2003. The suicide rate would seem to have been met by two opposing forces: on the one hand, the barriers would potentially reduce the rate. On the other, media reporting would possibly increase the rate.
A study conducted by Dr. Mark Sinyor looked at the effect of a barrier limiting access to lethal means on the rate of suicide, as well as the impact of media attention.
<strong>QUESTION</strong>
Does the way media reports on suicide impact rates of suicide?
<strong>STUDY </strong>
The first goal of Dr. Mark Sinyor’s study was to look at elements of media reporting and their relationship to suicide. Records from the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario of those who had died by suicide were examined and categorized by suicide method. Next, media reporting on suicide by local and national publications in the Toronto media market were examined, along with special attention paid to keywords related to suicide. If articles were related to the Bloor Street Viaduct, they were coded in relation to: 1) the Bloor Street Viaduct, 2) negative views about suicide barriers, and/or the cost of the barrier, 3) suicide deaths from a bridge other than the Bloor Street Viaduct, and 4) inclusion in the reporting of a hopeful message that suicide is preventable. Suicide rates before and after the barrier was erected were compared. Suicide rates were also examined in relation to media reporting.
The second goal of the study was to test for the effect of media reporting about the suicide barrier on suicide rates, both shortly after the barrier construction, and eleven years later.
<strong>RESULTS</strong>
There was an increase in suicide deaths shortly after construction of the barrier. Media articles mainly tended to focus on the cost and use of the barrier. In the long term, however, suicide rates on bridges, as well as by other means in Toronto, decreased after the Bloor Street Viaduct barrier was constructed. Media reports that contained hopeful messages were associated with decreased suicide rates. The study thus concluded that negative reporting initially led to a temporary increase in the suicide rate in the area, but that the barrier, in conjunction with the more positive reporting that accompanied the declining rates, ultimately had a positive effect.

He will compare those who just began antidepressant treatment with individuals in ongoing treatment for depression. He will also compare the risk of increased suicidal ideation and attempts in individuals who (1) use antidepressants only, (2) attend psychotherapy only, and (3) use both psychotherapy and antidepressant medications together.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>About 5% of people with schizophrenia die by suicide. Clozapine, which is an antipsychotic medication, is shown to reduce suicide rates in people with schizophrenia. Twin and family studies suggest that 30 to 50% of the risk for suicidal behavior in this group may be inherited. Identifying genetic markers of the risk for suicide and predicting the ability of clozapine to reduce that risk would provide a way to optimize suicide risk reduction. Neurobiological and genetic studies suggest that complex interactions of gene networks and environmental factors contribute to suicide. There is evidence for the involvement of genes engaged in intracellular signaling (i.e., genes that send messages within a cell), as risk factors for suicide and for a differential effect of clozapine on these crucial complex pathways, in particular, the EGF-MAPK-ERK pathway. In Dr. Meltzer’s study, 140 participants assessed for suicidal ideation and behavior and diagnosed with schizophrenia are evaluated using a case-control design to compare the DNA of those who have made a suicide attempt to those who have not in order to determine if there is a genetic basis to the suicide-preventing properties of clozapine.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Anxiety sensitivity and the way people make decisions, also known as cognitive bias, have been found to relate to suicidal ideation.  Cognitive bias modification (CBM) is an intervention that has helped change information processing biases in a positive direction among patients with anxiety disorders.
Anxiety sensitivity is thought of as a fear of arousal, and has been found to be a risk factor for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Anxiety sensitivity is often present for people with problems with anxiety, particularly panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Fortunately, anxiety sensitivity can be reduced using brief, educational interventions leading to improvement in mood and suicide symptoms. The investigators will modify current interventions for anxiety sensitivity by adding cognitive bias modification (CBM).  By changing biases in the way people with anxiety disorders process information the expectation is that anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation will be reduced. Moreover, the brief interventions can be delivered by computer, thereby increasing the capacity for speedy and widespread distribution.
In this study, patients with an anxiety disorder diagnosis plus moderate to severe current suicidal ideation (N = 82) will be randomly assigned to an active treatment or a control condition. Participants will complete a full battery of assessments before and after the interventions as well as during 1-month and 4-month follow-ups. The hypothesis is that those in the active treatment will show large reductions in anxiety sensitivity, and that these changes will lead to reduced suicidal ideation.
This portable, brief and computerized intervention can reduce anxiety sensitivity quickly without the use of expensive resources such as highly trained clinicians. The implementation of anxiety sensitivity reduction techniques delivered via the internet could lead to rapid dissemination of preventative interventions.
<strong>Impact: </strong>The development of an accessible and effective intervention for anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation would substantially advance our ability to prevent suicide among those who have anxiety disorders.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

<strong>Research Categories:</strong> Prostate cancer, suicidal behavior.
<strong>Abstract: </strong>Men with prostate cancer are two to four times more likely to die by suicide compared with men who have never had prostate cancer. While the statistics clearly show this higher rate, little is known about what aspects of the cancer or health outcomes contribute to later suicide. Dr. Recklitis intends to determine whether physical health issues like pain, incontinence, and sexual problems following cancer treatment contribute to a cancer survivor’s suicidal ideation. The study involves a survey mailed to former patients of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to assess patients’ physical and mental health as well as suicidal ideation. It is expected that 500 men will participate. Dr. Recklitis’s study will be one of the first studies of suicidal ideation after prostate cancer to focus on the role of the patient’s health after treatment.
<strong>Impact:</strong> To understand the role physical health problems play in suicidal ideation and behavior, which may lead to educating physicians and developing new interventions to meet prostate survivors’ needs.",Research Connection,"<strong>Background</strong>
Cancer survivors have been shown to be more likely to have suicidal ideation than their same age peers. Prostate cancer survivors share this risk. They are also typically over 65, which puts them in an age group with increased risk for suicide.
<strong>The Problem</strong>
We need to know more about the factors that contribute to this suicide risk.
<strong>The Study</strong>
Dr. Christopher Recklitis surveyed prostate cancer (PC) survivors who were first diagnosed 3 to 8 years before the study.
The survey asked survivors about suicidal ideation, depressed mood, suicidal ideation and demographic characteristics. The survey also inquired about pain, health-related quality of life, lifetime and recent recurrence, as well as the use of health services in the past 12 months.
The survey included:
<ol>
 	<li>The 26-item Expanded Cancer Index Composite Instrument (EPIC-26) about symptoms and PC treatment.</li>
 	<li>The Short-form 12 (SF-12).</li>
 	<li>The Beck Depression Inventory.</li>
 	<li>The Geriatric Depression Inventory.</li>
</ol>
<strong>The Results</strong>
The response to the survey was impressive, with 693 of 979 men completing the questionnaires.
<ul>
 	<li>Over 12% of men reported some suicidal ideation, with 5.2% reporting active suicidal ideation and 1.4% reporting serious suicidal ideation—all higher levels than peers without cancer.</li>
 	<li>Emotional and physical health, unemployment, pain, low income, and depressed mood (not clinically significant depression) were associated with suicidal ideation.</li>
 	<li>Having a previous mental health condition related to suicidal ideation.</li>
 	<li>Age, type of cancer treatment, time since cancer diagnosis, cancer recurrence, and other treatment factors were not related to suicidal ideation.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Takeaway</strong>
While most men fare well, some men with PC are at long-term risk for emotional and physical discomfort. Physicians should check in with patients about their pain (physical and emotional), address concerns about side effects and mood, and assess for suicidal ideation using several questions about different periods of time. For patients with pervious mental health conditions, a PC cancer diagnosis may increase their risk and extra attention may need to be given for their care and support.",Related Publications,"Recklitis CJ, Zhou ES, Zwemer EK, Hu JC, Kantoff PW.

<strong>Research Categories:</strong> Gender, male socialization.
<strong>Abstract: </strong>Does the way in which boys and men are socialized play a role in their increased suicide rate over that of women and girls? Dr. Smith hypothesizes that the greater exposure of men to life events involving physical pain, and to fear such as violence, injury, and trauma, will reduce their fear of death and increase their tolerance for pain. Decreased fear of death and increased pain tolerance combine to produce an acquired capability for suicide. One hundred men seen in a hospital psychiatric emergency room or admitted to inpatient psychiatric facilities will be interviewed and asked to complete questionnaires about their experiences, acquired capability for suicide, and suicidal ideation and attempts. Dr. Smith theorizes that men who adhere to traditional male gender norms involving restricted emotional expression, and those who report greater suicidal ideation in the presence of greater acquired capability for suicide, will be more likely to report a recent suicide attempt. These characteristics might help explain why men complete suicide four times as often as women.

<strong>Research Category:</strong> Psychosocial
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Since 1999, suicide rates have increased dramatically among middle-aged persons in the U.S., an age group that has historically shown stable or declining rates.  <em>Age effects</em><em> </em>refer to variations associated with the aging process due to differences in physiology, social roles and status. <em>Birth cohort effects</em> pertain to distinctions among groups of people born during the same period who encounter the same historical and social events at the same age while <em>period effects</em> are historical, social or environmental events that occur during a given time period and affect all age/cohort groups simultaneously. The project centers on the baby boom cohort (born between 1946 and 1964) and will incorporate birth cohorts that precede the baby boomers (born between 1920 and 1945) and those that follow them (born between 1965 and 1984).  Suicide risk will be considered over a wide scope of the life course from ages 18 up.  Due to data availability, the research will focus on the period between the mid-1980s through to 2011.  The risk of suicide by birth cohort starts to rise with Baby Boomers and continues to increase with subsequent birth cohorts. The changing nature of work and health in midlife has reduced social integration and regulation, which have been shown to be risk factors for suicidal ideation and behavior. Dr. Phillip’s study will use data on participants’ marital status (which is an indicator of social relationships), socioeconomic status, and health status (which would be an indicator of physical discomfort, depression, and economic strain). Cohort- and period-level measures will be combined from publicly-available surveys with individual-level variables from the National Health Interview Survey for the period 1986 to 2011. Hierarchical linear statistical modeling will be used to conduct age-period-cohort analyses.  It is expected that cohort and time period play a role in suicide risk above and beyond individual-level factors, and that the degree of social integration and regulation that characterize time periods and cohorts will also be important contributors.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>The Philippines is one of the most populous countries in the Western Pacific Region, but very little is known about the epidemiology of suicide and suicidal behavior in the country.  Barriers to reporting suicide make it difficult to determine the scope of the problem.   Although suicide rates are reportedly low compared to other countries, officially reported rates have more than doubled since the mid-1980s. Nonetheless, there is likely to be underreporting because of the strong stigma against suicide and shortcomings of the reporting system.
This study aims to determine if there is underreporting of suicide in the Philippines and to determine the methods by which underreported suicide cases can be identified. In addition, the clinical, social and demographic characteristics of people who have died by suicide will be examined. Two study areas were randomly selected, representing urban and rural populations in the Philippines. In-depth interviews will be conducted with key informants from these areas (Municipal Health officers, nurses, civil registrar officers, health center administrators, midwives, local government officials and police) to understand the reporting system for suicide events and to help identify unreported suicide cases. Using psychological autopsies, reported and unreported suicide cases will be validated. The records (death certificates, health center records) of validated cases will then be reviewed and compared with the psychological autopsy reports. The proportions and characteristics of cases identified in the interviews and other records will be compared to those cases registered in the records of civil registrar offices. The difference between these will be used as the measure of underreporting. The study will serve as a first phase of a systematic investigation of suicide in the Philippines. Information on the methods used for suicide and high risk groups are lacking from official statistics and such data are essential for the development and targeting of suicide prevention strategies. The study could inform on the most appropriate prevention strategies, which could then help reduce the burden of suicides in the Philippines.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Grief is the process of healing after loss, and sometimes this process becomes complicated. In complicated grief following the death of a loved one, feelings of loss are debilitating and do not improve even after time passes. Painful emotions are so long-lasting and severe that the bereaved person has trouble accepting the loss and resuming their own life. Severity of the condition can also be influenced by the cause of death; suicide deaths can be especially challenging in respect to grief. The overall objective of this multi-site study is to compare the efficacy of Complicated Grief Therapy with or without the medication citalopram. Both the medication and the therapeutic intervention have shown positive results treating complicated grief, and the question is whether one or the other has superior effects, or is the combination of the two optimal. For this study, 72 individuals who are bereaved by suicide loss are studied and compared with those who are bereaved from other causes of death who participated in a study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.  The goals are to determine if there are unique aspects to complicated grief when it results from a loss by suicide, and to determine potential treatments for those with complicated grief after a suicide.
<strong>Impact:</strong>  This study can significantly advance our knowledge of how to assist individuals who have lost someone to suicide and are experiencing complicated grief.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

<strong>Abstract: </strong>Thirty percent of U.S. women will have an elective abortion by the time they are 45. Dr. Steinberg compares women who have had an abortion versus childbirth in terms of suicide ideation and behavior. Some studies have found an association between elective abortion and subsequent suicide, suicidal ideation, or self-injury, and Steinberg’s study will consider the extent to which other factors, such as prior mental health, social disadvantage, and parental history may be accounting for this association.
Six Danish registries will be combined to create a database of approximately 350,000 women who had a first pregnancy end either in abortion or childbirth from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 2010. The Danish registries used are as follows; <em>The Danish Civil Registration System, </em>which will provide all of women in Denmark’s pregnancy’s and childbirths, <em>The Danish National Registry of Patients, </em>which will provide information on women’s abortion, <em>The Danish Psychiatric Central Registry, </em>which will provide information on previous mental health, <em>The Danish National Health Service Register, </em>which contains contact information for all psychiatrists, <em>The Integrated Database for Labour Market Research (IDA), </em>which will provide information on the education, income, and employment status of the women, and <em>The Danish Registry on Causes of Death, </em>which will provide the cause of death. Steinberg examines post-pregnancy suicide and suicide attempts in the context of mental health problems, social disadvantage, and parental illness.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> The lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community is found to be twice as likely to report having attempted suicide as their non LGBT peers. LGBT youth also tend to have less social well-being than LGBT adults so they tend to create their own online communities to enhance their social capital. Social well-being and connectivity is highly associated with being a protective factor against suicidal behavior. Dr. Lytle’s study uses machine learning statistical models to analyze linguistic (i.e., language) data from text messages to predict suicidal behavior. Data from the Trevor Project’s TrevorText over 100,000 anonymous members’ text messages will be analyzed. The study will examine the data and create a language model in order to detect variables that are prevalent in the LGBT community that are associated to suicidal risk such as, isolation, cultural factors, impulsivity, hopelessness, and stress. Ultimately this “machine” or model will learn to classify visitors as suicidal or non-suicidal. Dr. Lytle’s model will also analyze other important variables including the volunteers who work with TrevorText and common theories of suicide, such as Durkheim’s. The LGBT community has been shown to get involved with online communities and this research will include people who are struggling  and yet would not typically seek out help in person.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Child and teen medical inpatients are sometimes at elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, yet no standard screening tool exists to help physicians and nurses working in non‐mental health settings to guide them in recognizing pediatric patients at risk for suicidal behavior. Recently, Dr. Solages’ study team developed the Ask Suicide‐Screening Questions (ASQ), a 4‐item suicide risk screening instrument for use in pediatric emergency departments. Dr. Solages’ study will determine the efficacy of the ASQ among pediatric medical inpatients at an urban children’s hospital. Two hundred medically ill inpatients, ages 10-21, will be enrolled in this study, completing several short measures of suicidal ideation and risk—the ASQ, the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire, and a brief depression screen. As part of validation, all participants will be asked to answer feedback questions about being screened for suicide risk in a hospital setting. A psychiatrist will respond to all positive screens and conduct a full psychiatric evaluation, to ensure patient safety.

<strong>Abstract: </strong>The fibers in the brain’s white matter serve as information networks for sending messages throughout the brain. Their structure and functioning may relate to impulsiveness, as well as to suicide intent and lethality in people who have made a suicide attempt. Dr. Olvet will use an imaging technique called Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to discover how the structural integrity of white matter cells in the brain differs among three groups of participants: depressed individuals who have made a suicide attempt, depressed individuals who have not attempted suicide, and individuals with no psychiatric history. Dr. Olvet expects to find that individuals with a history of suicide attempts will have less white matter integrity than those who have not attempted suicide. She will also attempt to identify specific paths, or tracts, that might play a role in suicidal behavior.
