Support groups – also referred to as self-help groups – are groups of people who gather to share common problems and experiences. In a support group, people are able to talk with other folks who are like themselves – people who truly understand what they’re going through and can share the type of practical insights that can only come from firsthand experience.

Our meetings are open only to those who have lost a family member, friend, or coworker to suicide (not to observers or those who have survived a suicide attempt) and each suicide loss has equal value in the group.

We define and discuss the stages of the grieving process as they relate to suicide loss – shock and denial, fear and anger, guilt and shame, grief and sadness, and, eventually, acceptance and hope.

We encourage all group members to share openly, honestly, and from the heart. There is healing in talking about our feelings and comfort in knowing that we are not alone in our grief. But no one should feel pressured to participate – there is also healing in listening.

We provide a safe place to share our loss and are free to discuss our anger, fear, guilt, shame, embarrassment, disappointment, sadness, etc. in this meeting without fear of judgment, criticism, or condemnation.

We practice acceptance of others in this group.

We practice taking responsibility for ourselves by “staying in our own skin.”

We speak in “I language” and use healthy boundaries in our discussion.

We ask that you respect the group by speaking one at a time and not interrupting another group member.

All group discussions will be kept confidential. Anonymity is expected.

We practice respect for the beliefs and values of others.

We welcome you.",Laura Warburton,laura@livehannahshope.org,801-458-2997,United States of America,,,Huntsville,Iowa,51301,No,0
