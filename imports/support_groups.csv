Each suicide loss has equal value in the group.",Open,Laura Warburton,801-458-2997,laura@liveHannahsHope.org,1,,Continuously Throughout the Year,Twice a Month,,,,,,,,,United States of America,Partners in CAre,2075 NE Wyatt Ct. ,Bend,New Jersey,8035,Peer,No Charge,"We are a peer to peer support group. There are no licensed therapists contracted for the group. We welcome all who feel the pain of losing someone to suicide. We acknowledge that we all mourn differently. We reject shame in all its forms. This is an adult group 18 and older. No babysitting service is available. We are here to heal.

Support groups â also referred to as self-help groups â are groups of people who gather to share common problems and experiences. In a support group, people are able to talk with other folks who are like themselves â people who truly understand what theyâre going through and can share the type of practical insights that can only come from firsthand experience.

Our meetings are open only to those who have lost a family member, friend, or coworker to suicide (not to observers or those who have survived a suicide attempt) and each suicide loss has equal value in the group.

We define and discuss the stages of the grieving process as they relate to suicide loss â shock and denial, fear and anger, guilt and shame, grief and sadness, and, eventually, acceptance and hope.

We encourage all group members to share openly, honestly, and from the heart. There is healing in talking about our feelings and comfort in knowing that we are not alone in our grief. But no one should feel pressured to participate â there is also healing in listening.

We provide a safe place to share our loss and are free to discuss our anger, fear, guilt, shame, embarrassment, disappointment, sadness, etc. in this meeting without fear of judgment, criticism, or condemnation.

We practice acceptance of others in this group.

We practice taking responsibility for ourselves by âstaying in our own skin.â

We speak in âI languageâ and use healthy boundaries in our discussion.

We ask that you respect the group by speaking one at a time and not interrupting another group member.

All group discussions will be kept confidential. Anonymity is expected.

We practice respect for the beliefs and values of others.

We welcome you.",Laura Warburton,laura@livehannahshope.org,801-458-2997,United States of America,,,Huntsville,Iowa,51301,No,0
